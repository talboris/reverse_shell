# reverse_shell
server and client side reverse tcp shell

the shell is very simple and not multi threading yet, so only simple commands will work out

example of execution: 

on the server:  c:\python reverse.py 127.0.0.1 65432
on the client   c:\python client-reverse.py 127.0.0.1 654327

or runnig it from two different instances of cmd
